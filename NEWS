Version 1.0.2, Sun, 22 Mar 2009 17:20:12 +0200

  Another fix in dictem-postprocess-definition-remove-header.

Version 1.0.1, Fri, 20 Mar 2009 12:43:15 +0200

  - fix in dictem-postprocess-definition-remove-header.
    It wrongly deleted extra line

Version 1.0.0, Sat, 11 Oct 2008 18:59:15 +0300

   - Running dictem-initialize everytime your network/internet is up
     (if case you have no permanent connection to Internet,
     e.g. dial-up, adsl etc.) is a bit annoying. To avoid this dictem
     is (re)initialized (if needed) automatically from
     dictem-select-strategy and dictem-select-database functions.  As
     a result, running dictem-initialize in .emacs becomes unnecessary

   - New function (dictem-reinitialize-err) added

   - Minor fix in dictem-initialize-databases-alist function.  Now it
     returns error data in case of failure, not nil.
     (just like dictem-initialize-strategies-alist)

Version 0.82, Mon, 28 Jan 2008 22:59:07 +0200

  - FIX for emacs-22 (insert-string is replaced with insert)
  - Minor fixes in README

Version 0.81, Sat, 22 Jul 2006 15:45:53 +0300

  - dictem-server variable can be equal to nil, in this case
    'dict' command line tool will be called without -h option, i.e.
    default _list of servers_ specified in .dictrc (or dict.conf)
    will be used.

    dict:///dictionary_name (in dictem-user-databases-alist) also means
    that default server list will be used, see Ex.4 for the sample of use.

  - dictem-server variable now defaults to nil, old value was "dict.org".
    dictem-strategy-alist and dictem-database-alist also defaults to nil.

Version 0.8, Mon,  Sun, 28 May 2006 00:23:43 +0300

  - removed: ./configure / make / make install
    See installation section in README if you are in trouble

  - added: dictem-exclude-databases variable to disable some databases
    from autocompletion menu, see example 15 in README file.

    example for those who uses dict://dict.org:

        (setq dictem-exclude-databases
         '("tur-" "afr-" "ara-" "cro-" "cze-" "dan-" "hin-" "hun-"
           "iri-" "ita-" "kha-" "lat-" "nld-" "por-" "sco-" "scr-"
           "slo-" "swa-" "swe-" "tur-" "rom-" "wel-"

           "-tur" "-afr" "-ara" "-cro" "-cze" "-dan" "-hin" "-hun"
           "-iri" "-ita" "-kha" "-lat" "-nld" "-por" "-sco" "-scr"
           "-slo" "-swa" "-swe" "-tur" "-rom" "-wel"))

  - errors messages obtained from 'dict' command are printed
     in case initialization failure but the constant string.

Version 0.7, Mon,  3 Apr 2006 15:11:57 +0300

  - DICTEM can handle dictionaries defined by user.
    This allows to use dictem not only for accessing DICT servers,
    but also for accesing user's databases.
    See Ex.14 in README file for a simple example.

  - added: dictem-client-prog-args-list variable
    that keeps a list of additional
    arguments to the command line 'dict' client.
    This may be helpful in case you use 'dict' wrappers (having additional
    options) or new versions of 'dict' program.

  - added: dictem-option-mime variable.
    If `t' the OPTION MIME command (see RFC-2229 for details)
    will be sent to the DICT server. i.e. 'dict' program
    will be run with '-M' option.
    As a result server's response will be prepanded with MIME header
    followed by a blank line.
    Because of bugs in dict -M (dict version < 1.10.3),
    dict-1.10.3 or later is STRONGLY recommended.

    MIME-ized content can be postprocessed by functions called from
    dictem-postprocess-xxxx hooks. Because the current version of dictem
    doesn't contain such kind of functions, this variable should be used
    by those who program in Emacs.
    Suggestions and code are welcomed as always.
    Have a lot of fun ;-)

  - added: dictem-run-show-strategies function,
    similar to dictem-run-show-databases.

  - more complete dictem-mode's help string (documentation for dictem mode)

  - new examples of dictem usage in Ex.9 section

  - minor fixes in documentation and README

Version 0.0.5, Wed,  8 Jun 2005 19:56:56 +0300

  - new examples in README file: Ex.12-13

  - `dictem-postprocess-collect-hyperlinks' function
    (when added to `dictem-postprocess-definition-hook',
     `dictem-postprocess-show-info-hook' or
     `dictem-postprocess-show-server-hook' hooks) collects hyperlinks
     in the variable `dictem-hyperlinks-alist'.
     This variable is used by the function `dictem-hyperlinks-menu'
     which implements
     the autocompletion-based menu the same way `Info-menu' does.

    "e" is assigned to call the function `dictem-hyperlinks-menu'.
    The variable `dictem-hyperlinks-alist' is local to buffer.

  - If `dictem-use-existing-buffer' variable is `t'
    and dictem-use-content-history is not nil,
    the entire buffer content and (point)
    is stored in `dictem-content-history' variable when you click
    on hyperlink and thus you can easily return to the previous
    buffer by pressing "l" (`dictem-last' function).

    "l" is assigned to function `dictem-last'.
    It works just like the button <BACK> in the WEB browsers.

  - added: `dictem-postprocess-definition-remove-header',
      function for postprocessing DEFINE buffer.
      It is intended to remove header `XXX definition[s] found'
      at the beginning of dict's output
      and can be added to the hook `dictem-postprocess-definition-hook'.

  - fixes:
    `dictem-kill-all-buffers' has been reimplemented for using
    `dolist' macros instead of recursion.
    Recursion-bases implementation causes dictem to fail
    when lots of buffers exist.
    Thanks to Juri Linkov for bug reports and lots of suggestions.

  - String that begins hyperlink
      is stored in the variable `dictem-hyperlink-beginning', defaults to "{"
    String that ends hyperlink
      is stored in the variable `dictem-hyperlink-end, defaults to "}"
    Function that is called when hyperlink "define" is activated
      is stored in the variable `dictem-hyperlink-define-func',
      defaults to `dictem-base-define'

    All this stuff may be useful for more complex buffer postprocessing.
    Hyperlinks are not always enclosed in '{' and '}' braces.

Version 0.0.4, Thu, 24 Feb 2005 19:40:24 +0200

  dictem-default-database (dictem-default-strategy) variables override
  value of dictem-last-database (dictem-last-strategy) variable,
  i.e. when dictem-default-xxx is set to non-nil
  this database (strategy) is always used by default,
  otherwise the last used database (strategy) is used.

  All examples in README file are know numbered.

  New examples #10 and #11 in README file.

  By default dictem uses the default query as an initial
  input, this may be very useful.
  To disable this behaviour set `dictem-empty-initial-input' to `t'.
  See (describe-variable 'dictem-empty-initial-input)
  and REAME example #11.

  FIXED: `dictem-last-database' keeps "low-level" database name
  but the user's virtual one. As a result virtual dictionary
  could not be the default one (kept in dictem-last-database or
  dictem-default-database variable ).

Version 0.0.3, Tue, 14 Dec 2004 20:43:34 +0200

  DictEm has been ported to XEmacs

  Virtual dictionaries can access databases from different DICT servers

    (setq dictem-user-databases-alist
      '(("_translate" . ("dict://mova.org/mueller7"
                         "dict://dict.org:2628/web1913"))
        ("_ru-ru" . ("beslov" "dict://mova.org:2628/religion"))
        ))

    See README file for more information.

  The following commands can be run non-interactively.
     `dictem-run-show-info', `dictem-run-search' and
     `dictem-run-define' 

  `dictem-next-link' and `dictem-previous-link' skip hyperlinks on
    database names.

  Renamed: `dictem-url'       to `dictem-make-url'
           `link-create-link' to `dictem-create-link'

  DictEm's prompt looks like this: `<string> [<default>]:'

  New default faces

  Lots of README updates.

  A few fixes

Version 0.0.2, Tue, 30 Nov 2004 16:40:00 +0200

  added: new function `dictem-kill-all-buffers' killing all dictem buffers.
      The key "x" press in dictem buffer use it.

  dictem-postprocess-definition-hyperlinks function:
     When a substring {foo|bar} is encountered in a definition,
     `foo' is used for highlighting and `bar' is used for subsearch.

  new functions: `dictem-next-link' and `dictem-previous-link' which
     set pointer to the next (or previous) hyper link
  \M-n and \M-p key
     are assigned to `dictem-next-link' and `dictem-previous-link'
  When pressing RET (C-m) key on hyper link, subsearch
     DICT server is sent a DEFINE command

  added: new customizable variable: `dictem-use-existing-buffer'
      which can be used
      to use existing dictem buffer instead of creating a new one
      for subsearches. This variable is local to buffer.
